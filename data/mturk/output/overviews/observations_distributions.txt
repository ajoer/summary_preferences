There are two final data analysis splits:
	- all_biographies_min20
		- I've removed the race "other" from the results
		- I've removed all demographic groups with <20 preferences. (Only for analysis on their specific preferences. Their reviews are still included in the larger groups, e.g. "women" or ">30")
	- white-non_white
		- I've made the race split white/non-white
			- improves data scarcity
			- cuts to the chase
			- removes potentially important racial preference distinctions

** Demographics **
	- 2/3 older
	- 2/3 men
	- 79% white, 10% black, <4% all other races
	(really for US: 60% white, 18% Hispanic, 13% black, 6% Asian, 1.3% Am Indian) https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219
		- overrepresentation of whites, and underrepresentation of hispanics. 

Compared to Huff & Tingley 2015, (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168015604648), who compare the joint distributions of age, gender, and race among MTurk respondents within the United States, our respondents are older, and the proportion of women in our dataset is smaller. 
The proportion of white respondents in our sample is similar to theirs (75%), but we have almost twice the percentage of blacks (10%), and about half the percentage of Hispanics (2.5%) and Asians (3.3%). 
The average age in our data set is 43 and the median is 44 (this is true for ALL, MEN and WOMEN).

** Preference distributions on data WITH race split **

None of the results are significant on this data.

Both age groups and both genders prefer MatchSum in 52% of the cases and TextRank in 41-42% of the cases. The rest is neither. This gives a small preference to MatchSum in all major demographic groups, but only by slightly more than chance.

Regarding race, non-whites prefer MatchSum slightly more than whites (55% vs. ~51%). This is due to the preferences of the Am Indian, black and Hispanic turkers, since the Asian Turkers do not prefer one system over the other (38% for both systems). The Asian Turkers also have a much higher rate of "neither" than any other demographic group (25% vs. 0-7%).
The preference for TextRank is relatively stable across all demographic 1-level groups, and remains around 41% (with 38-44% as outliers).  

Looking closer at the 2-level demographic groups:

In Gender+Race, female Am Ind (71%), male blacks (60%) and male hispanics (56%) prefer MatchSum to a higher extend than the rates provided on 1-level demographics. 
Female white and male white have very similar preference patterns, with a very slight preference for MatchSum. Ditto black women. 
Within the 2-level groups, there is a difference between black men and women, but not between white men and women (black men prefer MatchSum).

For Gender+Age, young women do not prefer one system over the other (45% vs. 47%). There are no difference in preference patterns between the other three 2-level groups.  

The only groups to note in Race+Age are the two whites, since there is only one age group for the rest of the races. There is a slight preference by young whites to MatchSum (53% vs. 50%). The difference stems from the higher amount of "neither" in the >30 group, since the preference for TextRank is stable at 42%.

3-level demographic groups:

Only the gender/age splits in Whites is meaningful here, since the other races are age and/or gender singular. 
There is no preference difference between young and older female whites, but young, male whites prefer MatchSum to older, male whites (55% vs. 51%).


** Preference distributions on data withOUT race split **

Some results are significant on this data. Especially older (female) non-whites who strongly prefer MatchSum
	- young non-white vs. older non-white
	- older non-white vs. older white
	- young, female non-white vs. older, female non-white
	- older female non-white vs. younger, female white
	- older female non-white vs. older, female white
	- older female non-white vs. younger, male non-white
	- older female non-white vs. younger, male white
	- older female non-white vs. older, male white

Young females are indifferent to the two systems (46% vs. 47%).
Older non-whites strongly prefer MatchSum (69%), mainly due to the strong preference in MatchSum by older, female non-whites.


Qualitatively

(in these examples, MatchSum is preferred)
The textrank summaries often do not have an introdutory sentence, and the person about whom the summary is is not introduced:
	- TextRank: "Born in Rio de Janeiro, Lacerda was the son of a family of politicians from Vassouras, Rio de Janeiro state. Starting his political career in 1947, Lacerda was elected to the legislative chamber (city council) of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Lacerda was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies later in 1954, with more votes than any other candidate."
	- MatchSum: "Carlos Frederico Werneck de Lacerda (30 April 1914 – 21 May 1977) was a Brazilian journalist and politician. Born in Rio de Janeiro, Lacerda was the son of a family of politicians from Vassouras, Rio de Janeiro state. When he was a law student, Lacerda became sympathetic to left-wing ideas, but by the 1940s, he had transformed into a staunch anticommunist and conservative."

	- TextRank: "Ray directed 36 films, including feature films, documentaries and shorts. Ray's first film, Pather Panchali (1955), won eleven international prizes, including the inaugural Best Human Document award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. Ray received many major awards in his career, including 32 Indian National Film Awards, a Golden Lion, a Golden Bear, 2 Silver Bears, a number of additional awards at international film festivals and award ceremonies, and an Academy Honorary Award in 1992."
	- MatchSum: "Satyajit Ray (Bengali pronunciation:  [ ˈʃɔtːodʒit ˈrai̯ ] (listen); 2 May 1921 – 23 April 1992) was an Indian film director, writer, and illustrator. He was one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century. Ray directed 36 films, including feature films, documentaries and shorts."

	-TextRank: "From 1982 to 1988, he won seven Grand Slam singles titles (three at the French Open, three at the Australian Open, and one at the US Open), and one Grand Slam men's doubles title (at Wimbledon). He and Rafael Nadal are the only men in tennis history to have won at least two Grand Slam singles titles on each of the three surfaces (2 Australian when it was played on grass, 1 Australian and 1 US on hard, and 3 French on clay)."
	- MatchSum: "Mats Arne Olof Wilander (Swedish pronunciation:  [ ˈmats vɪˈlǎnːdɛr ]; born 22 August 1964) is a former world No. From 1982 to 1988, he won seven Grand Slam singles titles (three at the French Open, three at the Australian Open, and one at the US Open), and one Grand Slam men's doubles title (at Wimbledon). This occurred, more or less, simultaneously with countryman Björn Borg's decision to quit tennis."
 


There is an issue with cohesion in TextRank systems:
	- TextRank: "Elena Kagan (; born April 28, 1960) is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. After a nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C."
	- MatchSum: "Elena Kagan (; born April 28, 1960) is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 10, 2010 and has served since August 7, 2010. Kagan is the fourth woman to become a member of the Court."


Older, non-white women: prefer this

-------- OLD ---------

Demographic distributions are ~same between the three data splits (MEN, WOMEN, ALL): 
	- 35% <= 30, 30% women, ~80% white. 
	- Ditto deeper distributions, e.g. race+age

NB: preference for MatchSum means that the percentage of votes ""for"" MatchSum is >50%. The percentage of textrank here is not used, but rather the analysis focuses on the preference for MatchSum. A 40/50/10 preference distribution is not seen as a preference for MatchSum, since only half of the given population preferred the MatchSum system.

The MatchSum preference across gender, race and age is ~50% on all three splits.
Examples:
	- 50% of black women prefer MatchSum on ALL
	- 49.4% of white women prefer MatchSum on WOMEN
	- between 51-52% of <=30 and >30 and women and men prefer MatchSum on MEN (and WOMEN and ALL)


There are some distribution preferences that are too small to rely on, especially on the women biographies set.



Noticable preferences:

	WOMEN:
	- no results are significant! (only those involving amer indians)
	- black men on WOMEN prefer textrank, and white women do not prefer MatchSum on WOMEN
	- only black women and white men prefer MatchSum on WOMEN
	- There is a slight preference for non-white races to MatchSum on both ALL and MEN. This is not observed on WOMEN. 
	- male/white/<=30 prefer MatchSum, female/white/<=30 do not (tied).
	
	MEN:
	- significant results:
		- almost anything with amer indians
		- asian/<=30 vs. black/>30
		- black/<=30 vs. black/>30

Observation summary:

	- in both MEN and ALL there are significant results on female/black/>30 vs. almost anything EXCEPT male/black/>30. This is not found on WOMEN
	- male/american indian/>30 is significantly different to all other demographic groups on ALL.
	- female/black/>30 is significantly different to (almost all) other demographic groups (only not male/black/>30) on ALL
